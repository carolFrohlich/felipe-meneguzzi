					<div class="collapse" id="multiagent">
 						<div class="well">
    						Agent-based software is an established method for modelling an increasingly important number of network-centred systems. Unlike traditional object-oriented approaches to system modelling, agents are able to control their own internal state and behaviour, and have dynamic relationships among themselves and the environment in which they operate. Until recently, these agent properties have been largely explored on the theoretical level and many practical questions need to be addressed before agent-oriented programming becomes an everyday reality. Thus, practical agent programming languages make up a rapidly developing subfield within agent systems research, yet there are still many unresolved problems.
  						</div>
					</div>


					<div class="collapse" id="normativereasoning">
 						<div class="well">
    						Systems of autonomous and self-interested agents interacting to achieve individual and collective goals may exhibit undesirable or unexpected properties if left unconstrained. This has led to efforts in defining systems of norms, effectively formalised laws, in terms of obligations, permissions and prohibitions. However, only relatively recently has there been efforts in modifying agent reasoning mechanisms to process norms so that an agent can deliberately, as opposed to by design (or lack of mechanisms), comply with or violate norms. In this context, I contributed to the <a href="http://www.ist-contract.org/">CONTRACT project</a>, designing and implementing a number of agent reasoning mechanisms to process norms in the context of the aerospace engine care market. My work in this area focuses on designing algorithms for norm processing and integrating them into agent reasoning mechanisms.
  						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="collapse" id="bdi">
 						<div class="well">
    						One of the most widely studied agent reasoning models is based on the notions of beliefs, desires and intentions (or BDI) as mental attitudes that guide the selection of courses of action. In this model, beliefs describe knowledge about the world, while desires are states of affairs to achieve, and intentions are commitments to achieving a particular subset of desires. The BDI model has its origins in the philosophical work of <a href="http://humanexperience.stanford.edu/bratman">Bratman</a> to explain the way in which humans select a series of actions directed at the achievement of a larger goal while avoiding spending time considering less important ones. Most of my work on agent reasoning draws heavily on this particular model either directly, in my work on agent languages, or indirectly, in the architectures for proactive assistance I worked on.
  						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="collapse" id="agentprogramminglanguages">
 						<div class="well">
    						One major push of my research during my PhD was focused on creating agent languages and architectures that overcome these limitations by the integration of AI techniques within the underlying agent interpreters. In my thesis I created AgentSpeak(PL), an extension of a traditional logic-based BDI-style agent language, which includes a mechanism for processing goals in a manner that decouples goal achievement from plan execution, as well as generating new plans to cope with unforeseen situations at design time. AgentSpeak(PL) bridges the gap between agent languages and multiagent systems by introducing a simple cooperation mechanism together with a norm processing mechanism aimed at providing some degree of societal control.
  						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="collapse" id="aiplanning">
 						<div class="well">
    						Planning is perhaps the first thing that comes to mind when one thinks about Artificial Intelligence. Understandably, algorithms for deciding what to do have been one of the most prolific areas of research in the field. One of the main contributions in <a href="pubs/thesis-felipe.pdf">my thesis</a> was the integration of a planning algorithm to a BDI agent interpreter to strike a balance between human-optimized plans in a plan library and the creation of new plans at runtime to allow an agent to deal with situations not foreseen at design time. My interests lie in the relations that planning formalisms and algorithms have to agent reasoning, as well as the convertibility of deterministic planning formalisms (which are more straightforward for human planners) to stochastic planning formalisms.
  						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="collapse" id="proactiveassistance">
 						<div class="well">
    						Human users generally operate in complex dynamic environments where they face challenges due to cognitive overload in planning and replanning; that is, the users must perform multiple concurrent tasks including: collecting coherent information about the current situation, reasoning about constraints and policies, and dealing with uncertainty to achieve timely decision making. In order to help the users to cope with cognitive overload in such an environment, proactive agents can offer context-sensitive assistance by anticipating the users needs, autonomously planning assistive actions, and offering assistance in an appropriate format at a right time. While at CMU, I have worked on various architectures for proactive assistance in the context of information gathering for coalition operations. I also co-chaired (with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jeanoh/">Jean Oh</a>) the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/paa-2010/">AAAI Fall Symposium on Proactive Assistant Agents</a>.
